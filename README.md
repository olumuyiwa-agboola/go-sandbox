# Go Sandbox
Welcome to my sandbox for learning and experimenting with the Go programming language!

## 🎯 Learning Goals 
- Gain a deep understanding of Go's concepts, syntax and best practices.  
- Explore and experiment with core concepts such as types, functions, methods, and interfaces.
- Work through **_The Go Programming Language_** book by Alan A. A. Donovan & Brian W. Kernighan.
- Learn Go’s standard library for handling files, networking, and HTTP servers.  
- Build small projects to demonstrate concepts and reinforce learning.  
- Write clean, idiomatic Go code following best practices.
